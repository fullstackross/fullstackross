- :free:  Seeking to do pro bono work for charities that serve causes that matter to me including Blindness, Veterans, and Learning Disabilities. 
Willing to consider others, however, priority will be given to the aforementioned. 

:reminder_ribbon: I am a veteran and willing to mentor any other veteran of a NATO military on becoming a developer and learning to code.
